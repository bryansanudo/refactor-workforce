            The EB-3 'Other Workers' Visa, created by the US Government,
            provides an opportunity for foreign nationals to work in positions
            experiencing chronic labor shortages. With a yearly allocation of
            40,000 visas, the EB-3 program is a valuable solution for many.
            However, the most challenging aspect of the process is finding an
            employer who is willing and able to sponsor. This is where EB-3
            Workforce Solutions comes in. We partner with qualified employers,
            ensuring a smooth and successful sponsorship process for all parties
            involved.
          </p>
          <p className={`${styles.sectionText} px-4`}>
            The EB-3 "Other Workers" Visa is a great way to become a permanent
            resident of the United States. You can get this visa by changing
            your status or by going through consular processing in your home
            country. If you qualify, so do your spouse and any unmarried
            children under 21.

            Employers are having a harder time than ever before finding people
            to fill their low-skilled jobs. Industries like cleaning, food
            service, packing, and storage have been hit the hardest. Instead of
            closing their doors, many businesses have tried to find creative
            ways to find people to work for them. Many employers have found it
            helpful to sponsor potential immigrants who are willing to fill open
            positions with the help of an EB-3 visa for unskilled workers.
          </p>
          <p className={`${styles.sectionText} px-4`}>
            The Immigration Act of 1990 set up a program called
            "Employment-Based Visas," which lets US businesses sponsor foreign
            workers who want to work and are qualified to do so. There are five
            types of EB visas. The first two require skilled work and a lot of
            schooling, while part of the third type (the EB-3) is for people who
            can do unskilled work for their future employers.
          </p>
          <p className={`${styles.sectionText} px-4`}>
            The EB-3 "Other Worker" Visa process leads directly to permanent
            residency in the U.S., and the terms are better than most of the
            other ways to get there.
