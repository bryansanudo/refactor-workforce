            We have seen first hand this process work for many different people
            at many different stages in their lives. The EB-3 program kickstarts
            opportunity in the United States by providing a U.S. Green Card to
            the main applicant and their dependents. Read about some of our
            client's experiences with this Green Card process with BDV
            Solutions. No two cases are the same!

            This process gave this father the opportunity to get himself, his
            wife, and his young kids a U.S. Green Card. The COVID-19 pandemic
            put significant delays on getting a decision after their visa
            interview, but thanks to the BDV team fighting for their case, as
            the embassy began to open back up, the whole family got their visas
            approved.

            They now are building a new life in the United States and are
            creating many opportunities for their family. Through the EB3
            process, this family can live and work legally in the United States.
            Currently, the main applicant is still working for their employer
            which is in the Southeast of the United States. We can’t wait to see
            this family continue to prosper in the United States and live their
            American dream.

            This BDV Solutions client worked at a fast food restaurant in the
            mid-west United States. She worked for her employer for slightly
            over a year and was one of the first EB3 workers to begin work at
            that employer. Her employer declared her one of the best workers
            their restaurant has ever had. After she finished working, her
            employer actually treated her out to dinner. In addition, her
            employer also graciously supported her husband’s entrepreneurial
            endeavors. Now, some of her family is starting their Green Card
            journey with BDV Solutions.
          </p>
          <p className={`${styles.sectionText} px-4`}>
            This situation is a testament to the wonderful employers that we
            work with. The EB-3 employees don’t get special treatment and are
            held to the same standards as every other employee at the
            organization, but the employers we work with do care about the
            success that BDV Solutions clients have in this program. They
            celebrate green card approvals with the BDV team and BDV clients.
          </p>

            While this client is moving on to other work opportunities, some of
            our clients continue to work for their employer sponsors in a
            greater capacity because they were promoted to more advanced
            positions in the organization. There are lots of opportunities
            through the EB3 Unskilled Visa Program.
